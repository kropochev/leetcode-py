        Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point
        on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points
        to the origin (0, 0).

        The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean
        distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).
